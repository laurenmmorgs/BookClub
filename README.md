Here is an app that lets a user login and register, using SQL database we are able to save the user with a hash password. 
I used Bcrypt to hash the password, and then the users are able to add to a table where they can see on the dashboard who read what and what their thoughts were. 
Utiziling HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Java SpringBoot.
